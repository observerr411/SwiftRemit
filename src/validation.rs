/// Validates that an address is properly formatted and not empty.

/// Stellar addresses in Soroban are represented by the Address type,
/// which is already validated by the SDK, but we check for additional constraints.

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `address` - Address to validate
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(())` - Address is valid
/// * `Err(ContractError::InvalidAddress)` - Address validation failed
///
/// # Notes
///
/// The Address type in Soroban SDK is guaranteed to be valid by the runtime.
/// This function primarily serves as a placeholder for future validation logic
/// and to make the code more explicit about validation requirements.

    // that it can be properly serialized.
